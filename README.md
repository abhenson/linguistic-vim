# Linguistic-vim
There are many different approaches to perform linguistic analyses of text.
Linguistic analysis is only useful on non-programming text. There are methods to evaluate code but they do not fall into the category of linguistic analysis.
This script performs such analyses quickly and easily.
For example the value of the type-token ratio[1] is a measure of how diverse the words of the text are.
The closer the value is to one the more diverse the text.  

## Functions implemented at the moment:
